## Quiz Questions

#### 1. Who invented Git?
Linus Torvalds 
#### 2. What else is the person who invented Git famous for?
Linux kernel 
#### 3. What year was Git invented?
2005 
#### 4. What is the git command to initialize a new repository?
git init 
#### 5. In your own words, describe what the command `git push` is doing.
Git push takes the changes you've previously staged and then committed, and "pushes", or sends the code you previously forked, with your changes, to the Github branch you previously created. 
#### 6. What is the purpose of a `.gitignore` file?
.gitignore is used to NOT track files. Git will ignore the files associated with this command, and will not send push them as described in #5. This is useful for security features on data that is sensitive, and also on large files (node files?)we don't need to track that take a long time to process. 
#### 7. What is a fork? Why would you want to have a fork?
A fork is a branch repository, made from the main repository. It contains the code you will clone, and is also where code goes when it is "pushed".  
#### 8. What is a clone? How many clones can you have?
A clone is the actual copy of the code you forked from the main repository. It is basically a copy that contains all of the original code and commits, that the user can make edits to, without affecting the original code. I don't see why you couldn't have infinite clones. 
#### 9. Should you put a Github repository inside of another Github repository? Literally never. 

#### 10. You can type `git status` at any time while in a git repository - true or false? True!
